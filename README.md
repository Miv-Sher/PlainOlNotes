Google now offers a set of recommended components for architecting Android apps.
Android developers can learn how to follow these recommendations to improve their initial development process and simplify
long-term maintenance. In this course, learn best practices for building high-quality Android apps using the Android Architecture
Components for data persistence and display. Instructor David Gassner teaches these concepts in a real-world context by using the
Architecture Components to build a simple note-taking app from start to finish. He shows how to define an SQLite database with the
Room library, display a list of data with the efficient RecyclerView component, and update the user interface with observable LiveData
objects.
